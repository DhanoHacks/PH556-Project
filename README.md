# PH556-Project
# Usage:
* Store all science images (`.wcs.proc.fits` files) inside `processing/data` folder
* PSF Photometry done by `processing/psf_photometry.py`.
* Lightcurve fitting followed by distance calculations done by `processing/plot_data.py`
# Results:
* PSF Magnitudes of target extraced from all science images (with error and corresponding JD) - `processing/results.txt`
* Fitted light curve of target - `processing/lightcurve.png`
* Mean apparent magnitude of target, period of magnitude oscillation, and distance to target - terminal output by `processing/plot_data.py`
